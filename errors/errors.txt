# Error codes available to be reported on the errors MQTT topic
# To use in services, #include <error.h> (part of main/common)

# Services APIs aren't tracked, neither are BLE/modem. LPC devices use the registry. This unfortunately means there are
# multiple ways to specify errors. This list is meant as the "primary" index. To have LPC devices report errors
# (or "states") directly via the monitor service, match the datatypes: state_code enum indexing (1-indexed in powers of
# two) with below, then use the API in heartbeat_service.h. For services, indexing can be linear.
# Note for LPC, there is also the `state/{device}/{error_string} "true"` MQTT reporting, but due to BLE topics not
# supporting wildcards this is considered legacy.

# Generic LPC errors (in heartbeat.yml)
